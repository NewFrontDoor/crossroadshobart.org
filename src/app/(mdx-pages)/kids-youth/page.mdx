# Kids & Youth at Crossroads

We want to see young people saved, growing and engaged as followers of Jesus. There's a lot of young families among us, and we cater for infants right up to teenagers.

    ### Creche
    Creche is for ages 0-3. Kids are signed in and monitored by screened volunteers. We message parents if the kids are very upset or need changing / the toilet. They play with toys, read books and the 3-years olds do a simple Bible lesson and craft.

## Screened leaders, safe kids

We take seriously our responsibility to keep kids safe and are careful to comply with all government, church, and Biblical requirements. All our volunteers obtain [blue-cards](https://www.cbos.tas.gov.au/topics/licensing-and-registration/registrations/work-with-vulnerable-people) before commencing work with children. We also maintain our volunteers’ membership in the Presbyterian church of Australia’s own kid-safe program: [Breaking the silence](http://www.jerichoroad.org.au/bts/). As well as teaching and training, this program outlines codes of conduct for teaching, leading, and provides clear authority structures and reporting procedures.
