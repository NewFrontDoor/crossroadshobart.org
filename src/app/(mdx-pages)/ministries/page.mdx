# Ministries

## Sunday Gatherings

We gather at 4.00pm on Sundays to pray, listen to a sermon, sing Christian songs and spend informal time together. Our sermons tend to be exegetical. This means the content comes from a careful, week-by-week study of whole books of the Bible. Occasionally sermons are structured to respond to a topic.

### 4.00pm Sunday Gathering

Our Sunday service has a family focus with creche and Crossroads Kids programs run during the meeting. This caters for kids from infants to age 7 and is run by screened volunteers. We sing, pray, reasd the bible and hear a bible talk. This gathering finishes around 5:20pm with time to chat afterwards.

## Growth Groups

Christians grow as they hear the Bible taught and apply it to their lives in practical ways – this happens through the main meeting but also as we live our everyday lives alongside each other. The aim for our growth groups is that they be a space where we can be real, get involved and help each other grow in understanding and faith.

Growth groups meet at a range of times and locations during the week. The program changes from group to group but there's Bible study, reading of Christian books, prayer for each other's friends / family, and social stuff. You're welcome to come whether you're a church partner or not. Check in with the welcoming team in the church foyer, or send us an [email](https://www.crossroadshobart.org/).


# Kids & Youth at Crossroads

We want to see young people saved, growing and engaged as followers of Jesus. There's a lot of young families among us, and we cater for infants right up to teenagers.

## Screened leaders, safe kids

We take seriously our responsibility to keep kids safe and are careful to comply with all government, church, and Biblical requirements. All our volunteers obtain [blue-cards](https://www.cbos.tas.gov.au/topics/licensing-and-registration/registrations/work-with-vulnerable-people) before commencing work with children. We also maintain our volunteers’ membership in the Presbyterian church of Australia’s own kid-safe program: [Breaking the silence](http://www.jerichoroad.org.au/bts/). As well as teaching and training, this program outlines codes of conduct for teaching, leading, and provides clear authority structures and reporting procedures.
